causes.py scans the file word.list (a list of words) 
and determines the social network of the word "causes" 
as all of its friends, its friend's friends, its friend's 
friend's friends, and so on. 

Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance 
of 1. This means that the insertion, removal, or substitution 
of a letter in word1 lead to word2.
